STL Notes

std::advance - advance itr pos by n
std::generate, generate_n

Iterator Traits (7.5), traits, std::iterator<>

//
// Algorithms
//

std::for_each (coll.begin(), coll.end(), MyValue()) returns MyValue (Returns a copy of the [internally modified] op)

std::remove_copy, remove_copy_if
std::replace_copy

std::copy_backward

std::transform - for transformation (2 forms - for single range and 2 ranges)

swap, fill, generate,

std::rotate, rotate_copy
std::next_permutation, std::random_shuffle
std::partition, stable_partition

std::sord, std::stable_sord(keep an order of equal elems).
std::partial_sort - sorts only a part of range
std::partial_sort_copy
std::nth_element - sorts according to the n-th element

heap algorithms:
std::make_heap, std::push_heap, std::pop_heap, std::sort_heap (convert a heap into sorted collection)

sorted range algorithms:

std::binary_search - check Whether one element is present (to obtain the position of an element for which
you are searching, use lower_bound(), upper_bound(), or equal_range() )

std::includes - checking Whether Several elements are present

std::lower_bound, std::upper_bound - searching first  /  last possible position
std::equal_range                   - searching first AND last possible position

std::merge - processing the sum of two sorted sets
The destination range contains all elements that are in the first source range plus those that are in the
second source range.

std::set_union
Elements that are in both ranges are in the union range only once. However, duplicates are possible if elements
occur more than once in one of the source ranges. The number of occurrences of equal elements in the destination
range is the maximum of the number of their occurrences in both source ranges

std::set_intersection - Processing the Intersection of Two Sorted Sets

std::set_difference, std::set_symmetric_difference - Processing the Difference of Two Sorted Sets

std::inplace_merge - Merging Consecutive Sorted Ranges

// Streams
//

It is important to note for streams that are both read and written that it is not possible to switch arbitrarily between
reading and writing![8] Once you started to read or to write a file you have to perform a seek operation, potentially
to the current position, to switch from reading to writing or vice versa. The only exception to this rule is if you
have read until end-of-file. In this case you can continue with writing characters immediately.
Violating this rule can lead to all kinds of strange effects.

8] This is a restriction inherited from C. However, it is likely that implementations of the standard C++
library make use of this restriction.


The exact definition of pos_type is a bit complicated: The C++ standard library defines a global template class fpos<>
for file positions. Class fpos<> is used to define types streampos for char and wstreampos for wchar_t streams.
These types are used to define the pos_type of the corresponding character traits.
And the pos_type member of the traits is used to define pos_type of the corresponding stream classes.
Thus, you could also use streampos as the type for the stream positions. However, using long or unsigned long is wrong
because streampos is not an integral type (anymore).[9] For example:

[9] Formerly, streampos was used for stream positions, and it was simply defined as unsigned long.

   // save current file position
   std::ios::pos_type pos = file.tellg();
   ...
   // seek to file position saved in pos
   file.seekg(pos);

Instead of
   std::ios::pos_type pos;

you could also write:
   std::streampos pos;

The type for the offset is off _type, which is an indirect definition of streamoff. Similar to pos_type, streamoff is used
to define off_type of the traits (see page 689) and the stream classes. However, streamoff is a signed integral type, so
you can use integral values as stream offsets. For example:

   // seek to the beginning of the file
   file.seekg (0, std::ios::beg);
   ...
   // seek 20 character forward
   file.seekg (20, std::ios::cur);
   ...
   // seek 10 characters before the end
   file.seekg (-10, std::ios::end);


rdbuf (and tie) can be used for streams:

// stream for hexadecimal standard output
   ostream hexout(cout.rdbuf());
   hexout.setf (ios::hex, ios::basefield);
   hexout.setf (ios::showbase);

   // switch between decimal and hexadecimal output
   hexout << "hexout: " << 177 << " ";
   cout   << "cout: "   << 177 << " ";

copyfmt - could be used to copy format flags
