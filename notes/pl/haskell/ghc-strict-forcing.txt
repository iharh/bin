2. kmett - Once
https://www.fpcomplete.com/user/edwardk/snippets/once
http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1lo15w/deepseq_once/

data Once a = Once () a

runOnce :: Once a -> a
runOnce (Once _ a) = a

once :: NFData a => a -> Once a
once a = Once (rnf a) a

instance NFData (Once a) where
  rnf (Once () _) = ()


3. $!
f $! x - behaves as normal application of f, but the top-level evaluation of
         the argument expression x is forced before the function f is applied
f x y  - could be one of:
         (f $! x) y
         (f x) $! y
         (f $! x) $! y
Ex:
foldl'              :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
foldl' f v []       = v
foldl' f v (x : xs) = ((foldl' f) $! (f v x)) xs

4. MagicHash, UnboxedTuples

type STRep s a = State# s -> (# State# s, a #)
