Is an optimizer method that merges some function calls into one.
E.g.
map f . map g
can be substituted by
map (f . g)
and
filter p . filter q
can be substituted by
filter (\x -> q x && p x)
.

It can also help to remove intermediate data structures.
E.g. computing
sum [1..n]
does not require an explicit list structure, and the expression is actually translated into a simple loop.
